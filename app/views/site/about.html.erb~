	<p>Jabba was the brainchild of a group of friends from DCU who wanted to play Ultimate when the college season was finished. Our first ever tournament was Brighton Beyond in 2008, a great, fun tournament at the end of the summer.</p>
 
 <p>
From there Ian French was elected captain and the club really took off. Frenchy introduced a seriousness that had been missing before and started regular trainings and entering tournaments domestically. In 2009, Jabba took a huge leap forward. Jabba took a huge scalp at Mixed Nationals beating a great Binge side before finishing 4th overall. In September, Jabba were the only Irish team to go to xEUCF. This was the biggest tournament Jabba had ever been to and the highest level many of the players had played at. We found it tough but extremely rewarding to play against some great mixed teams. Although we only came away with one win, we came away with a mountain of knowledge. From then Jabba has continued to grow and grow.</p><br>
<p>
In 2010, Jabba finished in the top 8 at Siege of Limerick, a high level tournie. Jabba expanded from Mixed ultimate when our women’s team, Jabba the Huckers was formed to match the newly founded LMS. Huck o’the Irish, Ireland’s only women’s tournie, was set up by Fiona Mernagh and the Huckers and LMS battled it out in the final, with LMS just winning out. 2010 also saw Jabba finish 5th in Open Nationals, a great achievement as we played a mixed line all weekend.
</p><br>


<p>
In the last year, Jabba has exploded into national and international recognition. In our first tournie under Captain Fag, Jabba managed their highest finish at Cork Open, 3rd. We entered UK Mixed Tour 1 trying to do the best we could. By the end of the weekend we had exceeded all expectations and finished 13th. In the middle of May we returned to play Mixed Tour 3 with what have seemed like a weakened team, again we played magnificently all weekend and walked away with 13th place again (and not a single loss). With these results behind us we went into Mixed Nationals with great hopes. Unfortunately we met a great Rebel squad in the semi-finals and ended up with 3rd place, a finish that was not to be disregarded but one that didn’t satisfy our ambition fully.
</p><br>
<p>
Huck o’the Irish rolled around again and unfortunately so did the same result. However, this year high winds was the only difference between the teams as LMS started on offence and a break was near impossible.</p><br>

<p>
With the girls doing so well, the guys felt a bit lonely and lazy so they put all their efforts into growing a team for the Open division. We trained as much as numbers would allow and entered Open Nationals looking to improve on last year against a bigger and better field of teams and we managed exactly that. A hard fought and feisty semi-final was played against Broc and proved a step too far for our young team. We had to be satisfied with another 3rd place at a domestic tournie.
</p><br>
<p>
For the coming year, we are looking to improve on all our placings that we achieved this year, especially at Mixed and Open Nationals. We are also planning on attending all 3 Mixed, Women’s and Open UK tours as well as having fun at tournaments like Newcastle Resolution and Windmill Windup.
