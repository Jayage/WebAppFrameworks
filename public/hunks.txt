Jabba the Huck started off as a Mixed club that would enter into Open tournaments (and do damn well with the help of the girls I don’t mind saying). However, once the women’s team formed, the guys saw an opportunity to take things a bit more competitively and began to train as Open team Jabba the Hunk alongside Jabba the Huckers. This has proved to be a very fruitful move as the Hunks took home the winning trophy at Not the Worlds 2012, finished 6th in UK Open B Tour as their first ever foreign tournament (and with only 10 pairs of legs to do the work) and came 4th at All-Irelands 2012, again with just a small squad. Most recently they only narrowly lost the semi-final in universe point to Mohawks from Brighton at the Siege of Limerick.


This year the aim will be to equal or improve all of last season’s results. The team is getting stronger all the time and if things continue as they have been, there can only be bigger and brighter things in their future.


If you wish to be a part of this exciting and developing squad, e-mail captain@jabbathehuck.com. The team is open to all male players willing to commit and train hard, regardless of initial experience.
