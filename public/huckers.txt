Jabba the Huckers is a Dublin based Women’s team. We train together once a week as a separate branch of Jabba the Huck. If you’re interested in any of the following, you should definitely try us out:
 
1.    Playing tournaments domestically (All-Ireland Indoors, Siege of Limerick, Cork Open and more) and abroad (UK Women’s Tour and another undecided European tourney)
2.    Improving your game by training weekly, playing with and being coached by Irish international players
3.    Partying (with annual traditions such as the infamous Cake and Keg Day, we make other clubs green with envy)
4.    Meeting a lot of fun new people ranging from 17-40 years old!
We’re a team that doesn’t expect you to be the best; we promise to make you become your best.
Don’t worry though, we are also a club that is heavy on bonding time and prove it at tournaments, regular nights out and weekend trips away!
If you want to know more, please don’t hesitate to e-mail the women’s captain at womenscaptain@jabbathehuck.com or speak directly to any of our players. You can also check out our facebook group.
